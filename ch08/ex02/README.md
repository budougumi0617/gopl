# Exercise 8.2
Implement a concurrent File Transfer Protocol(FTP) server. The server should interpret commands from each client such as `cd` to change directory, `ls` to list a directory, `get` to send the contents of a file, and `close` to close the connection. You can use the standard `ftp` command as the client, or write your own.
