# Exercise 8.1
Modify `clock2` to accept a port number, and write a program, `clockwall`, that acts as a client of server clock servers at once, reading the times from each one and displaying the results in a table, akin to the wall of clocks seen in some business offices. If you have access to geographically distributed computers, run instances remotely; otherwise run local instances on different with ports with fake time zones.
